# Privacy-Aware-Travel-Assistant
In the era of digital assistants, Travel assistants are widely used in everyday travel to easily
access the route updates. On-route travel assistants requires continuous user location updates
from the start of the journey, during the journey and till the end. Currently there are various
approaches to protect the static user location such as location obfuscation, anonymity and
perturbation but the constant updating makes location correlation protection more challeng-
ing.
To address this issue, we propose using the Differential Privacy with RAPPOR mechanism to
construct a privacy protection mechanism that is based on user locations anticipated using
a Markov model rather than actual user locations. This aids in ensuring the userâ€™s location
privacy while also maintaining the linkage between them, hence increasing the effectiveness
of the system.
